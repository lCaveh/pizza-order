_A single page for a pizza shop. It shows the pizza shop's menu, and the user can click to item's pictures to see their description. Then the costumers can select pizzas, their sizes, and its toppings. They also have option to delete pizzas from their order. After submitting the order the website ask for address to delivery items.
